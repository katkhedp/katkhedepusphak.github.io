  <p>I am a current Grad student at Oregon State University studying computer science with a bachelor’s in computer engineering. Before this, I have 3 years of full-time professional experience as an Application Developer in DevOps vertical with IBM
    and a four-month
    internship with Tech-Amplifiers. During my professional experience, I worked in multiple verticals like software development, infrastructure, and potential client case studies. I believe it is vital to implement the theory that you learn in
    classes to solve real-life problems and I also get excited by seeing what different problems can be put on your plate. I believe a wide spectrum of technical skillset that I abreast partnered with my experience to communicate with clients
    representing the org, I would make a great addition as an Intern to the company. Although, I am very passionate about the work I am assigned I also strongly believe in the significance of cross-skilling and upskilling as per the business needs of
    the organization. </p>
